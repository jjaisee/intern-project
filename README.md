This website letzGet2gether is developed as server side rendered website using html,css,javascript,jquery, ejs as templating engine.
For backend I used the express js framework of node js along with mongoDB(NoSql) database. Further used mongoBD atlas for hosting the database.
Since the website is server side rendered, I used the passport js, oauth for authentication.

Things to be done:-
1) Design the contact Us page.
2) The working of search box needs to be implemented(backend).
3) Set the twitter, instagram, and email field in the footer and make the terms of service and privacy policy page then link them in footer.
